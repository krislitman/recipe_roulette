Allow the rice to cook for about 10-15 minutes, depending on the rice used. |Check it.  If the rice feels almost cooked, toss in the heavy cream and parmesan and give it a good stir.

Whisk it well, and leave it to come to temperature. You can turn it up slightly if you want, but don't leave it to sit unattended. |Once the cream has started to boil, whisk in your cheese just a little bit at a time.
