Easy Creamy Shrimp Risotto,4-8,10 Minutes,30 Minutes,"1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined|2 1/2 cups white rice (arborio, but to be honest you can definitely get away with using long grain rice just fine)|1 cup chardonnay|2 cups chicken stock|1/4 cup butter|3-4 cloves of garlic, minced|1/2 bunch of green onions, chopped (separate the white bottoms from the green tops and discard the roots0|1/4 fresh parmesan cheese|1/4 cup heavy cream|salt and pepper","In a large deep cast iron pot or dutch oven, melt the butter over medium-high heat.|Toss in the whites of your green onions and your shrimp.  Saute together until the shrimp is mostly fully cooked, hopefully browning slightly on the sides. |Add your garlic and your rice.  Stir fry everything together, browning your rice slightly.  This should really only take about 2-3 minutes. |Pour in your stock, bring almost to a boil and then decrease the temperature to low.  Cover. Allow the rice to cook for about 10-15 minutes, depending on the rice used. |Check it.  If the rice feels almost cooked, toss in the heavy cream and parmesan and give it a good stir.  Make sure to move any rice off the bottom so it's not sticking. Cover again and cook for another five or so minutes.  |Keep checking every five minutes until the rice is to your liking. |Top with the green onions, extra parm and serve alone or alongside some Lemon Pepper Chicken Sheet Pan Dinner.",Ashez
Creamy Shrimp and Linguine,4-5,15 Minutes,15 Minutes,"1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined|1 lb linguine (or whatever pasta makes you happy) cooked to package specifications|3 cloves of garlic, minced|1 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream|1/3 cup shredded parmesan (plus more for topping)|2 tablespoons butter|Italian Seasoning|salt and pepper","In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Once melted, add your minced garlic to it, and saute it for about 2-3 minutes. Don't burn the goddamn garlic. | Add your shrimp to the pot and stir through the butter. Season them with salt and pepper and Italian seasoning. Cook shrimp for about 2-3 minutes on each side until cooked through. |Add your heavy whipping cream to the saucepan. Whisk it well, and leave it to come to temperature. You can turn it up slightly if you want, but don't leave it to sit unattended. |Once the cream has started to boil, whisk in your cheese just a little bit at a time. It's going to want to stick and melt to the bottom. Prevent that from happening. Your sauce should begin to thicken slightly. Continue whisking until the cheese is fully melted. salt and pepper the sauce, and remove it from the burner. It will thicken some as it cools. |Pour your shrimp sauce over your cooled pasta and mix thoroughly with tongs or a pasta spoon. Sprinkle in some additional parmesan and allow the pot of pasta to cool. |Serve up! Garlic bread makes an amazing side, and hopefully, soon I'll have a perfected recipe for that.",Ashez
Copycat Marie Callendar's Kahlua Cream Cheese Pie,8,30 Minutes,50 Minutes,--CRUST--|19 Oreo cookies|6 tablespoons room temp butter|3 tablespoons sugar|pinch of salt|--FILLING--|8 oz room temp cream cheese|1/3 cup sugar|1 large egg|3 oz semi-sweet chocolate (chips are fine)|1 tablespoon heavy cream|1/4 cup Kahlua|1/2 teaspoon instant espresso powder dissolved in one tablespoon water|1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract|1/3 cup sour cream|1/3 teaspoon salt|--TOPPING--|1 1/4 cup sour cream|2 tablespoons sugar|1/2 teaspoon vanilla|pinch of salt|--FUDGE SAUCE--|3 tablespoons of water|3 tablespoons of sugar|1/8 cup cocoa powder,"Preheat oven to 350 degrees.|Put the Oreos in the blender. Blend them into a powder. The whole damn things. You might have to add a few at a time depending on the size of your blender. |In a bowl, combine your powdered Oreos along with the remaining crust ingredients. Mix until well combined and press evenly into a pie tin. |Using an electric mixer. beat cream cheese until smooth in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add sugar and egg and beat until fully incorporated. |In a microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate and heavy cream. heat on half power for 30 seconds and stir. Repeat if necessary, but watch the chocolate to ensure it doesn't burn. It should be melty and delicious. |Add the chocolate, sour cream, Kahlua, espresso, and salt to the cream cheese mixture. Beat until fully combined. |Pour mixture into the pie crust leaving about 3/4 inch empty at the top. You will have a little bit leftover, but if you don't leave space you're not going to have room for the topping. |Bake in a water bath for 40-45 minutes or until the top is set, but still jiggly. It will be all puffed up, but it'll settle down. |Remove the pie from the oven and water bath and place n a wire rack to cool enough that it's no longer all puffed up. About 30 minutes. Don't turn off the oven cuz this bad boy is going back in.|Meanwhile, make the fudge sauce. In a small pot combine all the fudge sauce ingredients. Heat on medium-high heat for about 1-2 minutes or until it thickens. It should boil and be bubbly. |Remove it from the heat and put it in the fridge to cool. It's super important that you cool this completely or you're going to make a giant mess later. Seriously. I've done it. Chocolate everywhere. It will thicken more as it cools.|Adjust oven temp to 400 degrees. |In a small mixing bowl combine all the ""topping"" ingredients. Stir them until they're all mix-y.|Assuming your cheesecake has cooled enough that you have some space at the top, cover it with your sour cream topping and smooth it down with a rubber spatula. |Scrape the cooled fudge topping into a pastry bag fitted with a small piping tip. If you don't have this, a small sandwich bag will do the trick but cut the smallest hole possible in the corner. |Make lines across the top of the pie horizontally. This part is hard (as evidenced by the blowouts in my lines in the photo, so don't beat yourself up over it) then drag a butterknife lengthwise through the lines to create the design. don't cut into the pie, just enough to make the design look correctly. |Bake the pie in the oven for 8-10 minutes, remove back to the rack to cool.|refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.",Ashez
